# OnTheMap
Udacity's Nanodegree OnTheMap portifolio app

## Project Overview
Students will create an app with a map that shows information posted by other students. The map will contain pins that show the location where other students have reported studying. By tapping on the pin users can see a URL for something the student finds interesting. The user will be able to add their own data by posting a string that can be geocoded to a location, and a URL.

## Why this project?
This project will give students an opportunity to post and retrieve data from a network resource using Apple’s networking framework. It will also allow students to authenticate a user.

## What will I learn?
* Accessing networked data using Apple’s URL loading framework
* Authenticating a user using over a network connection
* Creating user interfaces that are responsive, and communicate network activity
* Use Core Location and the MapKit framework for to display annotated pins on a map

## Why is this project meaningful to my career?
Working with data from networked sources is as important to iOS development as creating good user interfaces. Completing this project shows that a developer can both read and write from RESTful networked APIs.

## Project Submission
You will create an app with a map that shows information posted by other students. The map will contain pins that show the location where other students have reported studying. By tapping on the pin users can see a URL for something the student finds interesting. The user will be able to add their own data by posting a string that can be reverse geocoded to a location, and a URL

## How Do I Complete this Project?
**Note:** All submitted projects must compile in Xcode's most up-to-date **stable** release, which is currently: **Xcode 10.1** and Swift **4.2.1**.

1. [Read the project specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tPF1tmSzVYPSbpl7_JCeMKglKMIs3dUa4OrSAKEYNAs/pub?embedded=true) and/or [download an example](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/on-the-map-portfolio-app/id994619554?mt=8) of the app.
2. Review the project lesson again for an overview on how to use the Parse and Udacity APIs for On the Map.
3. Review the [grading rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2114/view) to see how your project will be assessed. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.
4. If necessary, review [Lesson 7: Common Networking Challenges](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud421) for detailed instructions.
5. Create your app!
